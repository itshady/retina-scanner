There are different ways of classifying the degree of seriousness of diabetic retionpathy, nonproliferative and proliferative. Which means that it is an advanced stage, where new blood vessels grow on the surface that can be seen in the fundoscopic image. Non-proliferative can be separated into: no retinopathy, very mild, mild, moderate, and severe.

It helps in diagnosing various eye conditions and systemic diseases. For this app, you use a light-emitting device called an LED and your phone camera to take a picture of the back of your eye. The LED must be close to the camera in order to direct light from the LED to the back of the eye and directly back to the camera. Your camera flash is too far from the camera to direct light to your retina and reflect it directly back to the camera.
